[Scale Generator](https://codebrews.github.io/scale-generator/)

This is my code Louisville front end web project and first completely self made web project in which I came up with the concept and design on my own. It is inspired by similar resources, as well as a desire to teach music theory to my students. I intend to do something a bit different with this website than others I have seen and I hope this will give a visual representation as to how musical scales are constructed. 

Goals:
- Display all of the musical notes in a row like a number line giving a visual representation of the order of notes --i.e. the musical alphabet. (This could possibly be vertical on smaller displays)
- Allow users to see the order of the notes based on any chosen starting note chosen from a drop down menu.
- Allow users to select a subsequent pattern of notes. (i.e. the most commmon pattern, known as the major scale) from a second drop down menu
- This selection would change styles so that the pattern darkens the notes unused within the subsequent pattern. This allows the user to see what notes exist in the subsequent pattern but also to see how the subsequent pattern overlays the pattern of existing notes. Just as the way scales work in music, simple math can be used to determine what notes are selected/used in the scale and which ones are skipped and thus darkened in the display. 
- Display a scale summary that only includes the used notes in the scale.
- Display the scale pattern. (a summary or explanation of the pattern dictating the notes chosen to be in the scale)
- Build functionality that will allow for future patterns to be added

Possible future goals:
- make initial display of notes scrole-able or slide-able and eleminate drop first drop down menu.
- Add more patterns.
- Add sounds to play the scale tones.
- Add displays that would show fingerings/locations of notes on various instuments.
- Add a feature that would determine/display only the theoretically correct alternate spelling of note name where appropriate.
